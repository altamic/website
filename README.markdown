# altamic's web site #

A git repository containing my actual web site deployed at 
[michelangelo.altamore.org](http://michelangelo.altamore.org).

It has been designed from scratch. It is simple, fast and 
responsive with a clean look.

Feel free to find how it is [generated](Rakefile) or how 
[CSS3 flexboxs](src/assets/css/style.css) are used to gain 
fluidity.
