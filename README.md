# altamic's web site #

A git repository containing my actual web site deployed at
[michelangelo.altamore.org](https://michelangelo.altamore.org).

It has been designed from scratch. It is simple, fast, responsive and with a clean look.

Feel free to find how it is [generated](Rakefile) or how
[CSS3 flexboxs](src/assets/css/style.css) are used to gain
fluidity.
